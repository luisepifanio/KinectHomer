  <p>
    <img src="warn-red-small.gif"/> This code makes use of only publically
    available information about the Plugwise protocol. This information is not
    definitive, so the code should be treated only as indicative. This
    implementation and the information it is based on are not endorsed by
    Plugwise.
  </p>

  <!-- =================== Description =================== -->

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    This is a Java implementation of the <a href="http://www.plugwise.com/"
    target="_blank">Plugwise</a> modules that monitor electricity usage. The
    code is a a bundle for <a href="http://www.osgi.org/"
    target="_blank">OSGi</a> (Open Services Gateway initiative). It is therefore
    not a standard Java application, but the core of the bundle contains
    everything that would be needed for such an application.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <var>PlugwiseTransceiver</var> class supports Plugwise Circles connected
    via a Stick. The Plugwise network should (perhaps) have first been set up
    using the Source. The following limitations or uncertainties apply:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      Various aspects of the protocol and its format are not yet known (to me or
      others).
    </li>

    <li>
      Sequence numbers from the Circle+/Circle are not used. Instead commands
      are sent one at a time, waiting for the response.
    </li>

    <li>
      It is unclear whether it is sufficient to periodically set the Circle+
      clock, or whether all Circle clocks need to be set. This is presumably OK
      since the Plugwise documentation says that it is the Circle+ that has the
      clock. It appears that Circles synchronise clocks with the Circle+ on the
      hour. It appears that clocks follow UTC, and have to be read or written by
      adjusting local time.
    </li>

    <li>
      A Circle sometimes refuses to respond to a valid request for a power
      buffer, as if the current buffer were locked. This problem goes away after
      the next buffer is written on the following hour. This may be related to
      using the Source in between runs of this bundle. The Source successfully
      reads the buffer even though the bundle does not.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    The bundle is not complete because it relies on the <var>CommAccess</var>
    bundle from the author to provide a serial port service using Sun/Oracle
    JavaComm 2.0. However, an alternative bundle (e.g. the Knopflerfish one
    based on RxTx) could be used.
  </p>

  <!-- =================== Installation =================== -->

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    As this is a standard OSGi bundle, it should be installed in the usual way
    for the platform. The only unusual feature is that the bundle uses a
    configuration properties file. The code to handle this assumes that <a
    href="http://www.knopflerfish.org/" target="_blank">Knopflerfish</a> is in
    use, so the properties file is expected to be in the Knopflerfish OSGi root
    directory.
  </p>

  <!-- =================== Operation =================== -->

  <h2>Operation</h2>

  <p>
    Circles are periodically polled to perform the following tasks:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      The Circle+ clock is set every 24 hours to the PC clock, starting
      immediately after the bundle is started.
    </li>

    <li>
      The Circle energy consumption for the past hour is retrieved at 1 minute
      past the first hour after the bundle is started.
    </li>

    <li>
      The Circle instantaneous power consumption is retrieved at the configured
      interval in minutes, starting at this interval after the bundle is
      started.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    OSGi events with the following parameters are supported. The format here is
    that supported by the <a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/appel/"
    target="_blank">Appel</a> policy language:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      <var>device_in(energy,lamp,lounge,14:00:00,70)</var> means 70 watt-hours
      have been consumed by the lounge lamp in the hour starting at 2PM. The
      total of all energy readings has the form
      <var>device_in(energy,,,14:00:00,130)</var>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <var>device_in(power,lamp,lounge,,110)</var> 110 watts are currently being
      consumed by the lounge lamp. The total of all power readings has the form
      <var>device_in(power,,,,650)</var>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <var>device_out(on,lamp,lounge)</var> switches the lounge lamp on, while
      "device_out(off,lamp,lounge)" switches it off. Any message type apart from
      <var>on</var> and <var>off</var> is an error. If the entity name/instance
      are not defined in the mapping given by the property files, the event is
      ignored.
    </li>

  </ul>
